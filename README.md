# **NASSCOM VSD DIGITAL VLSI SOC Design and Planning**

- This workshop, organized by **VLSI SYSTEM DESIGN (VSD) in collaboration with NASSCOM, focuses on Digital VLSI SoC (System on Chip) design and planning**.

- This workshop focuses on SoC design and planning, specifically using the Google-SkyWater 130nm open-source process and the OpenLANE flow. It guides us through the Physical Design (PnR) process, transforming an RTL netlist into a finalized chip design, covering the challenges of each stage. The workshop aims to empower participants to explore ASIC design flow and create their own chips, leveraging this innovative, open-source technology for accessible and automated chip design.
