# **NASSCOM VSD DIGITAL VLSI SOC Design and Planning**

- This workshop, organized by **VLSI SYSTEM DESIGN (VSD) in collaboration with NASSCOM, focuses on Digital VLSI SoC (System on Chip) design and planning**.

- This workshop focuses on SoC design and planning, specifically using the Google-SkyWater 130nm open-source process and the OpenLANE flow. It guides us through the Physical Design (PnR) process, transforming an RTL netlist into a finalized chip design, covering the challenges of each stage. The workshop aims to empower participants to explore ASIC design flow and create their own chips, leveraging this innovative, open-source technology for accessible and automated chip design.

# How to talk to computers
## L1 - Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die, and IPs
- A **PACKAGE** refers to the physical enclosure that surrounds an integrated circuit (IC) or electronic component. It provides both mechanical protection and electrical connections between the component (like a chip or IC) and the circuit board (PCB). The package type is important as it impacts the size, assembly method, and performance of the electronic circuit. So here in our workshop, we use **QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-lead) package**,  It is a type of surface-mount integrated circuit package. The number "48" refers to the number of pins or connections it has, meaning it has 48 leads. These leads are usually exposed on the bottom of the package instead of extending out like traditional leads in other IC packages.
- A package is the outer shell or enclosure that surrounds the chip (also known as the die) inside. The chip is the actual semiconductor component where all the electronic circuits and functions are embedded, while the package provides the necessary protection and external connections for the chip to communicate with other components on a circuit board. which is shown in the below figure,

- Inside the package, **wire bonds** are tiny wires (usually made of gold, aluminum, or copper) that connect the internal chip to the external leads or pads on the package. These wire bonds allow electrical signals, power, and data to flow between the chip and the circuit board, enabling the chip to function in electronic devices.
